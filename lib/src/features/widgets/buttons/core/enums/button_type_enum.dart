/// ## [ButtonTypeEnum] Enum Documentation
///
/// The `ButtonTypeEnum` enum is used to define different button types based on how content is displayed within a button. This enum helps in managing the layout and structure of buttons in a UI by categorizing them into types that define the placement of icons and text.
///
/// ### Values:
/// - **[titleOnly]**: Represents a button that only contains a title (text) with no icon. Used for simple buttons that rely solely on text to convey their purpose.
/// - **[iconAndTitle]**: Represents a button where the icon is displayed before or after the title (text). This is used when both an icon and text need to be displayed, with a focus on text first, followed by the icon.
/// - **[titleAndIcon]**: Similar to `iconAndTitle`, this represents a button where the title (text) is displayed before or after the icon. The icon is secondary to the title, but both are presented in a fixed order.
/// - **[iconTitleAndIcon]**: Represents a button where the icon appears on both sides of the title. Useful when the button is designed to emphasize both the icons and text symmetrically.
/// - **[iconOnly]**: Represents a button that contains only an icon, without any accompanying text. Typically used for buttons that rely on visual cues from the icon alone (e.g., a trash can icon for delete action).
