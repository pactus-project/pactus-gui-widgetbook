/// ## [PalletColors] Enum
///
/// ### **Description**
/// `PalletColors` is an enumeration that defines a set of color identifiers
/// used within the application's custom color palettes.
/// These colors are typically mapped to specific color values
/// in different theme extensions, such as `YellowPallet`.
///
/// This enum provides a structured way to reference colors
/// within the `fromPalletColor` extension method.
///
/// ### **Usage**
/// ```dart
/// Color backgroundColor = context.fromPalletColor(PalletColors.yellow500);
/// ```
