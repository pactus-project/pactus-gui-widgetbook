# Widget Book for Pactus GUI

Welcome to the **Widget Book for Pactus GUI**! This project serves as a dedicated library of reusable widgets designed specifically for use within the **Pactus GUI**â€”a graphical interface built for interacting with the Pactus blockchain.

## About the Widget Book

The Widget Book provides a centralized environment to:

- **Explore**: View and interact with widgets in isolation.
- **Document**: Maintain clear and consistent documentation for each widget, making it easier to understand their purpose, usage, and customization options.
- **Test**: Validate the appearance and behavior of widgets across different states, configurations, and themes.
- **Collaborate**: Facilitate a shared understanding within the development team by presenting widgets in a standardized format.

## Benefits to Pactus GUI Development

1. **Enhanced Consistency**:
    - Ensures that the widgets used across Pactus GUI adhere to a uniform design language.
    - Reduces inconsistencies in user interface elements.

2. **Increased Reusability**:
    - Widgets developed in this library can be reused across multiple screens and features of Pactus GUI.
    - Promotes modular and maintainable code.

3. **Improved Collaboration**:
    - Simplifies communication between developers, designers, and stakeholders by offering a visual reference for components.
    - Streamlines the feedback process.

4. **Streamlined Development Process**:
    - Accelerates UI development by offering ready-to-use, thoroughly tested components.
    - Enables parallel development by allowing developers to work on widgets independently from the main application.

## Key Features

- **Component Showcase**: View widgets with real data or mock data.
- **Theme Support**: Test widgets in light, dark, or custom themes to ensure compatibility.
- **State Management**: Validate widgets in various states (e.g., loading, error, success).
- **Documentation Integration**: Embedded markdown or inline documentation for each widget.
- **Interactive Customization**: Modify widget properties on the fly to observe real-time changes.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the Widget Book:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

4. **Navigate Through Widgets:**
    - Use the navigation panel to explore different widgets.
    - Interact with customization options to tailor the widget behavior.
